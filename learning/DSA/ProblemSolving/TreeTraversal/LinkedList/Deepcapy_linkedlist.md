Problem Description
A linked list A is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or NULL.

Return a deep copy of the list.

Problem Constraints
0 <= |A| <= 106

Input Format
The first argument of input contains a pointer to the head of linked list A.



Output Format
Return a pointer to the head of the required linked list.

Example Input
Given list
   1 -> 2 -> 3
with random pointers going from
  1 -> 3
  2 -> 1
  3 -> 1
  


Example Output
   1 -> 2 -> 3
with random pointers going from
  1 -> 3
  2 -> 1
  3 -> 1

Example Explanation
You should return a deep copy of the list. The returned answer should not contain the same node as the original list, but a copy of them. The pointers in the returned list should not link to any node in the original input list.
